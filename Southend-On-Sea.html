		<h1> Southend-On-Sea is a coastal city and unitary authority area with borough status in southeastern Essex, England</h1>
		
		<p>Southend-on-Sea is home to the world's longest pleasure pier, built in 1830 and stretching some 1.34 miles (2.16 km) from shore</p>
		<p>The Kursaal was one of the earliest theme parks, built at the start of the 20th century. It closed in the 1970s and much of the land was developed as housing</p>
	
		<h2> History</h2>
		<p>Southend was home to a few poor fishermens' huts and farms at the southern extremity of Prittlewell Priory land. In the 1790s, landowner Daniel Scratton sold off land on either side of what was to become the High Street. The Grand Hotel (now Royal Hotel) and Grove Terrace (now Royal Terrace) were completed by 1794, and stagecoaches from London made it accessible.</p>
		<p>As a holiday destination, Southend declined from the 1960s onwards, as holidaying abroad became more affordable. Southend became the home of the Access credit card, as it had one of the UK's first electronic telephone exchanges (it is still home to RBS Card Services â€“ one of the former members of Access), with offices based in the former EKCO factory, Maitland House (Keddies), Victoria Circus and Southchurch Road.</p>

		<h3>Demography</h3>
		<p> Southend is the seventh most densely populated area in the United Kingdom outside of the London Boroughs, with 38.8 people per hectare compared to a national average of 3.77</p>

 <h1>Zimbabwe</h1>
 <img src="zim.jpg" alt="The Zimbabwean Flag">
<p>Zimbabwe, landlocked country of southern Africa.</p>
<p> It shares a 125-mile (200-kilometre) border on the south with the Republic of South Africa and is bounded on the southwest and west by Botswana, on the north by Zambia, and on the northeast and east by Mozambique.</p>
<p> The capital is Harare (formerly called Salisbury). Zimbabwe achieved majority rule and internationally recognized independence in April 1980 following a long period of colonial rule and a 15-year period of white-dominated minority rule, instituted after the minority regimeâ€™s so-called Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965.</p>

<h1>The Land</h1>

<p>Zimbabwe lies almost entirely over 1,000 feet (300 metres) above sea level.</p>
<p> Its principal physical feature is the broad ridge running 400 miles from southwest to northeast across the entire country, from Plumtree near the Botswana frontier through Gweru (formerly Gwelo) and Marondera (formerly Marandellas) to the Inyanga Mountains, which separate Zimbabwe from Mozambique.</p>
